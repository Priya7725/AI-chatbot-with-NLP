# AI-chatbot-with-NLP

Creating an AI chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK or spaCy sounds like an exciting project! Here's a basic outline to get you started:

**1. Setting Up Your Environment:**
   - First, ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the necessary libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install nltk spacy
     ```

**2. Importing Libraries and Loading Data:**
   - Import the libraries and load the necessary data.
     ```python
     import nltk
     import spacy
     
     # For NLTK
     nltk.download('punkt')
     from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

     # For spaCy
     nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
     ```

**3. Building a Basic Chatbot:**
   - Tokenization:
     ```python
     def tokenize(text):
         # Using NLTK
         tokens_nltk = word_tokenize(text)
         
         # Using spaCy
         doc = nlp(text)
         tokens_spacy = [token.text for token in doc]
         
         return tokens_nltk, tokens_spacy
     ```

**4. Implementing a Simple Response System:**
   - Responding to user input based on predefined rules.
     ```python
     def respond(text):
         tokens_nltk, tokens_spacy = tokenize(text)
         
         # Simple rule-based responses
         if 'hello' in tokens_nltk:
             return "Hi there!"
         elif 'bye' in tokens_spacy:
             return "Goodbye!"
         else:
             return "I'm not sure how to respond to that."
     ```

**5. Putting It All Together:**
   - Creating an interactive loop for chatting.
     ```python
     print("Welcome to the chatbot. Type 'exit' to end the conversation.")
     
     while True:
         user_input = input("You: ")
         if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
             print("Chatbot: Goodbye!")
             break
         
         response = respond(user_input)
         print(f"Chatbot: {response}")
     ```

This is a very basic example to get you started. You can expand it by adding more sophisticated NLP techniques, such as intent recognition, entity extraction, and using machine learning models for more dynamic responses.
